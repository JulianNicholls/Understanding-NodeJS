# Understanding-NodeJS

Javascript from the Udemy [Understanding NodeJS course](https://www.udemy.com/understand-nodejs/learn/)

**NB**: If you use the webserver files from section 7 unchanged,
you will need to make some configuration changes. I have set up a number
of aliases in my `/etc/hosts` file, including node.local, i.e.

```
127.0.0.1 localhost     # This line will already be in there

127.0.0.1 node.local    # This is the line that I added
```

Otherwise, you can replace the `'node.local'` in the `listen()` call in the
files with either `'localhost'` or `'127.0.0.1'`

Feel free to contact me if you have any questions.
