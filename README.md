# Understanding-NodeJS

Javascript from the Udemy Understanding NodeJS course at https://www.udemy.com/understand-nodejs/learn/

**NB**: If you use the webserver files unchanged, you will need to do the same as I have done.
I have set up a number of aliases in my ```/etc/hosts``` file, including node.local, i.e.

```
127.0.0.1 localhost     # This line will already be in there

127.0.0.1 node.local    # This is the line that I added
```
